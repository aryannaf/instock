## How to run the application

1. Clone both the instock and instock-api repositories from the following links

https://github.com/JimmyZ98/InStock

https://github.com/lizardskelly/InStock-api

2. Type `npm i` in both command lines to install all dependencies

3. In the instock-api command line, type `node index.j` to run the server

4. After confirmation the server is running, type `npm start` in the instock (client side) command line to open the app
